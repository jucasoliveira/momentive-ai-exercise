```

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

## The idea behind the exercise

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.

The objective: Write an application to implement a simple website that displays a list of 200 books retrieved from the sample [Faker Books API](https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/books?_quantity=200). 
## The link component

Next.js has [a custom Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).
